 * rejects "a separate navigation item in addition to the app name that
 * redirects to the app's homepage": the app name in the admin nav is that
 * link. What the nav does carry is a hidden `rel="home"` entry naming `/app`
 * as the route that name opens — see `web/lib/navigation`.
 *
 * The entries depend on the shop: Orders is left out while order transfer
 * is off. Saving the order settings is an action, and React Router reloads
 * this loader after every action, so the menu follows the switch at once.
