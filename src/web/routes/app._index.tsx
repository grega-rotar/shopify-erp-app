/**
 * The operations dashboard.
 *
 * docs/BUILD_SPEC.md section 2.7 is explicit that a static welcome card fails
 * Built for Shopify: the home page has to be dynamic and diagnostic. It
 * answers four questions, in this order, and leaves out a section with
 * nothing to say:
 *
 *  1. **Is it set up and running?** The setup banner, only until Finish
 *     setup has been pressed. A running store has no banner: healthy is calm.
 *  2. **Does anything need me?** Needs attention, one row per area with its
 *     count and a link to the records, never the records themselves.
 *  3. **How is each part doing?** Store operations: MetaKocka, orders,
 *     inventory, products, translations and sales, two or three facts each
 *     (`web/lib/home`).
 *  4. **What happened recently?** The last few events, in words, one per
 *     kind (`web/lib/activity`).
 *
 * Everything is read from our own database. Section 2.5 forbids a page load
 * awaiting MetaKocka, and nothing here calls Shopify either: coverage and
 * sync times are the stored ones the Translations pages keep. The only
 * write is the shop row a first visit creates.
