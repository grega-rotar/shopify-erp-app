 *    in as it. Specs add what they need with the seed helpers. Afterwards the

 *  - App Bridge replaced by tests/e2e/support/app-bridge-stub.js;
 *  - checks after the test: no uncaught error in the page, no background job
 *    of the shop's that failed (the test waits for its jobs to settle), and
